This plugin will allow Mattermost users to have their conversations over a game of chess.
The plugin is only for the Mattermost frontend and doesn't make any changes to the server.
Game data is held in the custom messages that are generated by users when they perform an action in the game.
Basic functions have been implemented but at this point it's still more of a demo than a completed project.

Uses [chessboard.js](https://chessboardjs.com/) and [chess.js](https://github.com/jhlywa/chess.js/).
