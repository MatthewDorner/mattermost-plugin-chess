This plugin allows Mattermost users to have their conversations over a game of chess. The plugin is only for the Mattermost frontend and doesn't make any changes to the server.

At this point, the plugin allows you to challenge a user to a game by clicking on the user's name in any channel to bring up the user popover menu and selecting "Challenge User to Chess". The challenge will create a new private channel and both users will be invited. The user to play first will be decided at random. Clicking on the "Open Game" link in any of the posts generated by the plugin will bring up the gameboard. The gameboard populates its game state by looking for the most recent plugin-generated post in the channel, which will have the game state data embedded in it. Any action a user takes in the game will generate a new post in the channel which will contain the updated game state.

Uses [chessboard.js](https://chessboardjs.com/) and [chess.js](https://github.com/jhlywa/chess.js/).
