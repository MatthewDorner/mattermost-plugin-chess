 * preloadedState - Any preloaded state to be applied to the store after it is initially configured.
 * appReducer - An object containing any app-specific reducer functions that the client needs.
 * persistConfig - Any additional configuration data to be passed into redux-persist aside from the default values.
 * getAppReducer - A function that returns the appReducer as defined above. Only used in development to enable hot reloading.
 * clientOptions - An object containing additional options used when configuring the redux store. The following options are available:
 *     additionalMiddleware - func | array - Allows for single or multiple additional middleware functions to be passed in from the client side.
 *     enableThunk - bool - default = true - If true, include the thunk middleware automatically. If false, thunk must be provided as part of additionalMiddleware.
